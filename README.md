# Image-processing-lab
This repository contains the lab assignments for an Image Processing course. Each lab focuses on different image processing techniques, such as histogram manipulation, enhancement, and image segmentation.

## Labs Overview

1. **Medical Image Enhancement Based on Histogram Algorithms**
   - This lab focuses on enhancing medical images using various histogram-based algorithms. These techniques are essential for improving image quality and visibility of important features.
   - **Topics Covered:**
     - Histogram equalization
     - Contrast enhancement
     - Adaptive histogram techniques

2. **Segmentation d'Images (Image Segmentation)**
   - In this lab, we explore several image segmentation techniques, which are used to divide an image into meaningful regions. Segmentation is crucial in various applications such as object detection and medical imaging.
   - **Topics Covered:**
     - Threshold-based segmentation
     - Region-growing methods
     - Edge detection algorithms

3. **Manipulation et Ã‰galisation d'Histogramme (Histogram Manipulation and Equalization)**
   - This lab dives into histogram manipulation and equalization methods for improving image contrast. Histogram equalization is widely used to enhance the contrast of an image, making it more visually appealing or suitable for further analysis.
   - **Topics Covered:**
     - Histogram plotting
     - Equalization algorithms
     - Image contrast adjustment
